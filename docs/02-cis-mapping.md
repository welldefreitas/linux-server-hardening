# CIS Mapping (high-level)

This repo is CIS-inspired (not a full CIS automation).

## Controls coverage
- SSH hardening: aligns with CIS SSH recommendations (restrict root login, auth controls)
- Firewall baseline: aligns with host firewall requirements
- sysctl network hardening: aligns with kernel networking hardening guidance
- auditd rules: aligns with audit and accountability controls
- fail2ban: supports brute-force defense-in-depth
